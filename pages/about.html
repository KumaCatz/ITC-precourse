                <p><span title="Hi! :)">Greetings to the people around the globe</span>! My name is Haim, or Rodrigo, and in these brief lines I hope to share a little bit of who I am, and hopefully you can do the same in the contacts page too! *-*</p>
                
                <p>First of all, I have a gorgeous and wonderful little cat named <em>Kuka</em>! She's with me a few years now and has been a lifesaver, and my closest family here in Israel. My current job is at a rehabilitation center as a tutor, and most of my free time is either studying or watching psychology videos on Youtube.</p>

                <p>I've been given this study oportunity at <span title="Israel Tech Challenge">ITC</span> from a former work coleage of mine, and <span title="ouch! xD">failed the first submission</span>. I hope to have improved since then, and learned a thing or two about studying on my own!</p>

                <p>I know the world is a gentle and welcoming place, and as such, I'm excited to put my all into this! And may we all be succesfull in our goals!</p>

                    <p>I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil, and lived with my parents all my life. I then moved to Israel as a young adult, and lived in Jerusalem for a few months, learning the language in a boarding school. Then Sderot, a few years later, to study medical engineering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19" title="like, corona sideways >_>">(that went sideways...)</a>, and <span title ='For now! :>'>Bat Yam</span>, a city close to the center of Tel Aviv. My journey is callous, but I've learned that the world and it's people are good. Let's make it better for everyone, together!</p>
